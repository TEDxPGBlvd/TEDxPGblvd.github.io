    "tedxplanation2": "TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxYouth@PleasantGroveBlvd, where x = independently organized TED event and the youth represents the fact that this event is being organized by a youth! TEDx organizer Ammon Hasson is a student at Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy whose initiative is to bring local ideas to life on the TED stage. At our TEDxYouth@PleasantGroveBlvd event, TED Talks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.",

    "name": "Shannon Cannon",

    "title": "Classical Education: Revisiting ancient learning",
    "bio": "Shannon Cannon comes from a large family of educators, including her grandmother, both her parents, and four siblings. For her teaching is a mission rather than a job. Shannon graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.A. in education and has completed graduate work at George Wythe University and Utah Valley University.  Along the way, Shannon educated her own children and hundreds of others in all kinds of settings including public school, home school, co-ops, and charter schools. She currently teaches U.S. history and English at Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy where she enjoys incorporating the principles of classical, liberal arts education into her classroom. The power of digging into classics to discover and apply principles has become not just a career, but a way of life. She believes that the “arts of freedom” are vital if we are to maintain a virtuous and healthy society and world. She and her supportive and comedic husband, Doug, are the parents of nine amazing children. "

She's ghostwritten more than a dozen books on topics ranging from nutrition to personal finance, she's appeared on the ABC national news show 20/20, and she is a popular keynote speaker. She's passionate about empowerment and goal setting, organization (see comment about list making) as well as cool vocabulary words and grammatical oddities. 
Some of her past favorite jobs include film critic, magazine editor, on-air broadcast talent, and advertising executive. In short, she still doesn't know what she wants to do when she grows up, but she loves trying it all. Her proudest accomplishment is her part in the "Widtfeldt 5," which is her family of  husband Pete and children Lauren, Connor, and Trey."

A US Presidential Scholar candidate and National Merit Scholar Finalist, Luke has dedicated himself to learn as much as he can, partly because he lives with a subset of obsessive-compulsive disorder called Existential OCD. While at Maeser, Luke has lettered in 4 sports and served as a captain on the state-winning men’s volleyball team. Luke plans to play volleyball at the NCAA Division I level but has not decided on a school yet. One of Luke’s non-academic passions is music. Since the third grade, Luke has played the guitar, writing and singing songs, some of which he thinks are good enough to publish to his YouTube channel. At age 15, Luke was promoted to the position of on-site supervisor for referees after working as a referee for 3 months for Provo Parks and Recreation. At 16, he quit his job and was the youngest hire ever at the Sundance Foundry Grill as a food expeditor. Currently, Luke still works at Sundance, but spends his free time working on an app he plans to release to the public in late 2020. Luke taught himself how to code Swift and Python.Luke plans to major in Economics and a form of engineering in college."
